> [LevelDB][LevelDB] is a simple key/value data store built by Google, inspired by [BigTable][BigTable]. It's used in Google Chrome and many other products. LevelDB supports arbitrary byte arrays as both keys and values, singular get, put and delete operations, batched put and delete, bi-directional iterators and simple compression using the very fast Snappy algorithm.
> 
> [LevelUP][LevelUP] aims to expose the features of LevelDB in a Node.js-friendly way. All standard Buffer encoding types are supported, as is a special JSON encoding. LevelDB's iterators are exposed as a Node.js-style readable stream.
